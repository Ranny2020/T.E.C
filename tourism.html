        <h2>GUJAM CAVE: A HAVEN OF RICH HISTORY AND CULTURAL DIVERSITY</h2>
        <p>
          Bagau, also known as Gujam, is a village with a rich history. The name Gujam originates from the Karai-Karai
          Language, meaning "big hole" or "deep well." The people of Bagau originated from Jalam village and later merged
          with other Karai-Karai people from Dafchi village. Together, they formed a large settlement called Ganuwar Gujam,
          now located in Pakarau Ward, Nangere Local Government Area, Yobe State.
          <br>
          Gujam Village was a prominent town around 1750 AD, before the arrival of European colonizers in Nigeria.
          The Kogon Gujam, a large hole or well was dug around 1750 AD by the people of Bagau as a result of wars 
          between the Karai-Karai people and the Kanem-Borno Empire. The Cave served as a hiding place and a means of 
          defense against enemies.
          <br>
          Years later, the cave was taken over by the Kuraye people, who made it their home. According to historical accounts,
          the Kuraye people lived in the Cave for many years without harming the people of Gujam village or their aminals.
          The reason for the Kuraye people's return to the cave is attributed to the change of name from Ndala Bagau to Ndala
          Gujam, meaning "The Cave of Gujam". The Cave is remarkably deep, allowing one to walk for kilometers
          ungerground, and its end remains unknown. Attempts were made to explore the cave during the colonial era but are 
          unsuccessful.
          <br>
          In 2024, the Nangere Local Government Area, under which Gujam village falls, initiated a survey of the Cave with the
          help of experts.
